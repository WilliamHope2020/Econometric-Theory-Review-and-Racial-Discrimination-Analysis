# Econometric-Theory-Review-and-Racial-Discrimination-Analysis
This relates to my 3rd Econ 323 - Econometrics Analysis 2 assignment. The first half of the assignment reviews econometric theory principles. The second half involves crime data to examine possible racial discrimination. From the analysis, I conclude that there is no direct evidence of racial discrimination, but convict discrimination.
